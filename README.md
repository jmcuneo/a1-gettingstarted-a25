This project is my personal site for the first assignment of CS4241.  
It contains information about me (name, class year, major, CS courses taken, current courses, experience, and interests).  
It is hosted on Render and managed using GitHub and Node.js.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:  
  I added multiple custom rules in `mystyles.css` to give the page a unique look. Examples include:  
  - Dark gray background (`#393232`) and monospace font for a coding feel.  
  - `h1` styled with centered alignment and bright green (`#AAE05E`).  
  - `.sub-title` bolded and given a neon-green color (`#5EE079`).  
  - `h2` underlined with a wavy green line.  
  - `ul` list items styled in teal (`#5EE0A5`).  
  - `footer` styled with a black background and centered neon text.  

- **JavaScript animation**:  
  I created a script (`myscripts.js`) that changes the color of my name (`#name`) every 0.7 seconds.  
  This cycles through five bright colors smoothly using `setInterval`.

- **Semantic HTML tags**:  
  I used `<footer>` to close the page with a short message.  
  I also used multiple `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags for structured content.

## Design Achievements
- **Color palette**:  
  I used a neon-inspired palette of greens and yellows applied consistently across the page:  
  - Background: `#393232`  
  - Main title: `#AAE05E`  
  - Subtitles: `#5EE079`  
  - Section headers: `#74E05E`  
  - Body text: `#E0E05E`  
  - Lists: `#5EE0A5`  
  This palette gives the site a modern, high-contrast look.

- **(Optional enhancement)**: I kept the font as monospace (`Courier New`) to match the coding/terminal aesthetic.
