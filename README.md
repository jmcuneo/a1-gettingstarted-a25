## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:

## 1. Sticky Navigation Bar with Smooth Scrolling

What I did:
I created a nav bar that stays on top of the screen, as well as smooth scrolling when you click any of the links of the nav bar.

Why it was challenging:
Trying to make the spacing of the nav bar work with the sections took a bit of time, and I hadn't known about the sticky attribute.
## 2. External CSS & JavaScript Integration

What I did:
I added glow to the logo when you hover over it using a seperate JS file.
Why it was challenging:
Ensuring that the Render server was able to access the JS file took a bit of time.
## 3. Custom Fonts from Google Fonts

What I did:
I imported two fonts, Newsreader for body text and Poppins for headers using Google Fonts.

Why it was challenging:
I wanted to make sure that the fonts were complimentary to each other, and that took some time to figure out.  I also didn't know how to effectively import the fonts.

## 4. Responsive Layout

What I did:
I made a cohesive layout, using different sections instead of having it all be under one body.  
Why it was challenging:
Trying to make the entire website cohesive as well as interactive took some time to figure out, but once I got one section done the other two were easier.

## Design Achievements
## 1. Dark Mode Theme with Accent Colors

What I did:
I used a dark background color (#0D0D0D) with light text (#F2F2F2) and green accents (#5DA668) for hover states and highlights.

Why it was challenging:
It took a while to find a good color pallete that was nice on the eyes, as well as something that I liked in the end.

## 2. Typography for Visual Hierarchy

What I did:
I combined Newsreader  for main text with Poppins for headers, giving the page a clean and structured appearance.

Why it was challenging:
Finding two good fonts that complimented each other took a bit of time.

## 3. Section-Based Layout and Spacing

What I did:
I separated content into clearly defined sections with consistent padding, margin spacing, and header styles.

Why it was challenging:
Trying to find a design that not only was cohesive but visually pleasant took a good amount of time to find.
