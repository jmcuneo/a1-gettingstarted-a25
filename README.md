## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Made the headings, paragraphs, and lists different colors. Indented paragraph text. Centered the image and the header/footer text.
- **Simple Javascript Animation**: I did not attempt one.
- **Used Semantic Tags**: Used header, footer, img for the giant blinking eye.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a monochromatic blue color scheme**: As shown in ColorWheel.png, I made a palette on color adobe and used each color by making them variables to call in CSS.
- **Used the Oswald Font from Google Fonts**: I used Oswald as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
