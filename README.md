This project is my submission for Assignment 1 of CS4241.  
It introduces me, my background, and my experience with different technologies.  
I have also implemented CSS styling, JavaScript animation, and semantic HTML to meet the technical and design achievements.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS (5 rules)**  
  I applied multiple CSS rules for full credit, including:  
  1. Styled the `body` with a Google Font, background color, and text color.  
  2. Customized `<header>` and `<footer>` with background colors and padding.  
  3. Styled headings (`h1`, `h2`) with a different palette color.  
  4. Styled `<a>` links with hover effects.  
  5. Styled `<table>` with borders, padding, and centered alignment.  

  This was challenging because I had to carefully pick colors that worked together while still making the text readable.  

- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**  
  I wrote a script that changes the background color of the `<header>` every 2 seconds, cycling through my Adobe Color palette.  
  This was my first time animating colors with `setInterval`, so I experimented until it looked smooth.  

- **Used additional semantic HTML tags**  
  I added several semantic tags to improve structure and accessibility:  
  - `<nav>` for navigation links.  
  - `<section>` for organizing content.  
  - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to display an image with description.  
  - `<table>` to present my technology experience in a clear way.  
  - `<footer>` with credits and a link to WPI.  

  This was a good exercise in making the page more structured and accessible.

## Design Achievements

- **Created and applied a color palette from Adobe Color (10 points)**  
  I generated a color palette using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com).  
  The palette included a deep red (#9a031e), dark teal (#0f4c5c), purple (#5f0f40), orange (#fb8b24), and light gray (#f5f3f4).  
  I used these colors consistently across backgrounds, headings, links, and accents.  

  This was challenging because I had to make sure all the colors worked together for accessibility and readability.

- **Used a font from Google Fonts (5 points)**  
  I imported the Roboto font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and applied it to the entire page.  
  This gives the site a more modern look compared to the default browser fonts.

## AI Usage Statement

I used ChatGPT as a resource in the same way I would use Google or online documentation.  
Specifically, I asked for:
- Clarification of the assignment requirements.  
- Examples of how to structure my `index.html` with semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Ideas for how to implement the technical and design achievements (CSS rules, JS animation, semantic tags, and font usage).  

I reviewed and edited all generated examples to make sure I understood them and that they met the assignment requirements.  
All final code and design choices were my own.

## Summary

This assignment helped me practice editing HTML, applying CSS styling, using semantic tags, adding simple JavaScript, and deploying a Node.js project to Render.  
The hardest part was balancing the design (colors and layout) with accessibility and keeping the code organized.
