## Technical Achievements

- Styled page with CSS  
  I created a separate styles.css file and applied multiple rules, including:
    - Body styling: background color, font, margins, and line spacing
    - Header and footer: red background color, white text, padding, and rounded corners
    - Main title: white text for readability on the header background
    - Lists: yellow-orange background #E8480E, padding, and square bullets
    - Animation box: size, background color, rounded corners, and a bouncing animation using keyframes

- Added JavaScript animation  
  #F28D3A, #F55014, and #E8815B for animation box start and animated colors

- Used semantic structure in HTML  
  I included sections for:
    - Header for the site title
    - Footer for contact information
    - Main content area for paragraphs and lists
    - Table for coursework listing
    - Links for the Outing Club website and email contact

## Design Achievements

- Created and applied a color palette  
  I created a custom palette and used all six colors across the site:
  #E8220E for header and footer background  
  #E86E0E for section headings  
  #E8480E for list background  
  #E80E4C for table borders and main text color  
  #E8920E for main link color
  #FFF7F5 for body background color

  A screenshot of the color palette is included in the repository.

- Used a Google Font  
  I applied the Roboto font from Google Fonts as the primary typeface for the site by linking it in the head section and referencing it in styles.css.
