This project shows a simple HTML website with information about myself and my experience in work and computer science. It examples some HTML tags stylized with CSS and even some Javascript features. I designed the site to include some interactivity, like a soundboard and music player, to make it more specialized and personable to myself, however I made sure to use royalty free sounds.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body to provide a background color to the page, and apply a font for the basic text on the page. I created a separate "content" div to display most of the actual information on the page and to provide a different accent background color and borders, as well as centering the text and most elements on the page. I gave the ul elements extra stylization, giving them more attention with colored borders and well packed bullet points. The elements I gave a bold font and gave the h1 a background color, turning it into a sort of banner across the top of the site. For a few other elements on the screen, I played with positioning. I gave the music player (#musicplayer) a fixed location in the bottom right of the screen and used a border to make it stand out from the rest of the page, and similarly the soundboard (#soundboard) I placed with an absolute position inside of the content div, out of the way of the text content but without being in the way.
- **Added a Javascript animation**: Made an animation to play on load where an image of a lemon (my favorite fruit) bounces and rotates behind the content on the page. It moves a set distance on the x and y axis until it hits a set bound-- approximately on the edge of the screen-- and changes direction. I'm not too familiar with javascript but I've attempted making a web extension before so I was familiar with object selecting from HTML. I had to pull up some resources for how frames work, but the most difficult part was trying to keep the image, which is anchored in the top left of the picture, from overflowing onto the bottom or right side of the window, causing the scroll bar to appear when it isn't necessary. I tried to limit this by reducing the bounds at which the lemon changed direction, which isn't perfect but I think it's alright.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I wanted to use an image for my animation anyways, so I used the img tag for that. I also ended up using the audio tag for the music player, which was not too difficult. Building the soundboard required quite a few tags, which I was not too familiar with. I used "input" tags to create the radio buttons and attached "label" tags to them. I had more difficulty with the button, which I hadn't realized would require a significant amount of javascript to function. I had to do a little research to understand, but I was able to attach a javascript function to the button which would read from the radio buttons.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Handlee and Knewave Font from Google Fonts**: I wanted my site to have a more relaxed feel to it, using a handwritten looking font for the titles and text. I used a nice bold, marker looking font for titles and a simpler, thinner font for basic text. I almost wish the body text font was a bit thinner, but I think the two selected fonts work well together.
- **Created color palette from Adobe**: My favorite colors are pink and yellow, so I selected a range that was within that. I tried to use the paler yellow shades as background while the colors closer to salmon and pink I used as accent shades.
