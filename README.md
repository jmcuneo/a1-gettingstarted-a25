This project demonstrates basic use of HTML tags, CSS selectors, and JavaScript animation.

## Technical Achievements
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Used a table, link, image, button, and footer on the website. I also used JavaScript to provide interaction between the button and image, as described below.
- **JavaScript Animation**: Added functionality to the button element by adding a handler for when it is clicked. When the button is clicked, an animation is applied to the image, which changes the opacity from 1 to 0, making it invisible. Once the animation is done, I set the opacity permanently to 0 so that the image stays invisible.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules to several elements on the page. This includes floating for the two columns of the page, formatting the borders for the table, selecting the first column in the table and changing the color, adjusting the global font, and setting the image size.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the DM Sans from Google Fonts**: I used DM Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used color palette from Adobe**: Used split complementary harmony colors from Adobe. Unfortunately I closed the page before screenshotting the wheel but I provided an image with the 6 colors used (colors.png)
