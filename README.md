This project showcases my ability to structure an HTML document, style it with the appropriate css, and incorporate JavaScript into the page for client side functionality. I first put enough content to achieve the basic requirements as described in the assignment requirements, with some slight styling such as some responsive styles and a different font. Then, I created a color scheme and created styles based on this color scheme. Lastly, I added some extra content in order to implement features for the technical achievements section. The CSS and JavaScript was somewhat difficult because I haven't touched "vanilla" CSS or JS in years. I am used to tools and frameworks like nodemon, SASS, React, Jekyll, etc.
