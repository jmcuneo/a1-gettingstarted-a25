# Matthew Franco  
https://a1-matthewfranco.onrender.com

This project is a personal profile page for Matthew Franco, created for CS4241 Assignment 1. It features:

- A header section with a profile picture and a brief introduction.
- Clickable LinkedIn and GitHub icons that open my profiles in new tabs.
- A button that displays an alert when clicked, implemented with JavaScript.
- A section listing technical experience, working experience, and previous computer science courses.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS:** I created a custom stylesheet (`styles.css`) to style the HTML elements, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and icons. I implemented a fade-in animation for my profile picture using CSS keyframes, which required learning about CSS animations. I also used advanced CSS filters to recolor the GitHub icon to purple on hover, which was challenging because it required experimenting with filter values to achieve the desired color effect.
- **JavaScript Feature:** I added a button that will alert the user using JavaScript.
- **Image and Icon Linking:** I added clickable icons for LinkedIn and GitHub that open my profiles in new tabs.
- **Additional HTML tags:** I experimented with other tags such as `<footer>`, `<a>`, `<br>`, `<img>`, and `<span>`.

## Design Achievements

- **Custom Font:** I imported the Overpass font from Google Fonts and applied it to the entire site for a modern look.
