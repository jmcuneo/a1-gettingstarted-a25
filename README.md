This project shows a simple HTML website with CSS styling and JavaScript. It has information about myself such as my name, class, major, CS courses I've taken, and coding experience. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the html and body selectors to change the background color, font, and margin. Styled the header, footer, h1, h2, h3, p, a, and ul selectors to add padding and font color/weight. Styled the table, th, td, and tr selectors for the table's color and border. Also made it highlight a row if hovered over. Styled the img, #container, and #animate selectors to add padding and align the animation.
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: Wrote a simple script that animated a cat moving across the screen in a loop by continuously updating its position until it reaches the end of the page.
- **Used other semantic HTML tags**: Added two images on the website along with a header and a footer. Used a table for my coding experience levels and added links for my email and GitHub in the footer.

## Design Achievements
- **Created color palette from Adobe Color**: I used a monochromatic color palette generated from Adobe Color for the site.
- **Used the Figtree Font from Google Fonts**: I used Figtree as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
