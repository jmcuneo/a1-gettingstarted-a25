This project shows a static website made with simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website contains information about myself, including: year of graduation, major(s) and minor(s), the computer science courses I have taken at WPI, and my experience with specific technologies and methods. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the text tags h2 and p. Styled the header and footer tag to match in color and padding. Styled the body tag to remove margins. Styled the table, th, and td tags to customize the table. Added rules for img and ul to match left margins.
- **Added a simple JS animation**: Added a simple looping panorama of the WPI campus to the end of the page, right above the footer.
- **Used other semantic HTML tags**: Added a header, footer, image, table, and link element to my webpage. The link element is found inside the footer tag. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used the PT Sans from Google Fonts**: I used PT Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used Adobe Color to create a color palette**: I used Adobe Color to generate a complimentary 5-color theme for the webpage.
