  - **h2** - Slate blue text color and made bold
  - **h3** - White text color and included a border bottom line to separate each section
  - **ul li** - Added a dark blue background for each bullet, included margins and padding for readability, and roundsed the corners using border-radius

  - **a/a hover** - Made text light blue color, removed underline from inital link, and made bold. On hover the text color becomes slightly darker and the underline returns
  - **button** - Made background light blue, made text dark blue for readabilty, removed borders, included a left margin, used border-radius for rounded edges, and made it so the cursor changes to pointer when its on the button

### JS Animation
Implemented a simple interaction for when the button next to the recipe link with the text "Click me to see how they look!" is clicked, an image of the baked good that the recipe makes fades in to view. This is done by setting the image display from "none" to "block" and moving the opacity from 0 to 1 over the period of a second.
