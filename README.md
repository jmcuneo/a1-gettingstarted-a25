This project shows my name, graduating year, major and possible minor, cs classes I have taken, and my experience with certain technologies and methods. It displays this information on a static webpage, making use of different HTML semantic tags, styles, and animation.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, ul, h1, h2, h3, img, footer, and link sectors. I aligned headers and text (not including lists) to the center, changed all fonts to Gaegu, changed font sizes based on location (larger for p and ul, smaller for the footer), changed the font color for different text based on the generated color pallette, changed header background color based on the generated color pallette, made list style "none", and set the margins for the image at the top of the page to auto. Also created shapes for JS animation by setting width, height, color, border radius, and position. It was a challenge to center the image before I remembered to adjust the border margins.

- **Added JS Animation**: Using W3Schools as a base, I created a continuous JS animation with a yellow circle representing a fish, where once a button was clicked, the "fish" would move diagonally across the blue rectangle representing water. It was challenging thinking of how to keep the "fish" continuously moving within the designated space, but I came up with the solution of resetting the x and y position values when they got too large.

- **Added Extra Semantic HTML Tags**: In addition to the tags already used, added h3, h4, img, footer, button, and link sectors, as well as additional h2, ul, and p sectors. I used these to make the website more dynamic and fun to look at, with different formatting, text sizes, text colors, and visuals. The button is used to start the JS animation. Figuring out how links worked was a little confusing, but reviewing the lecture video as well as referencing W3Schools made understanding a lot easier.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Gaegu Font from Google Fonts**: I used Gaegu as the font for the primary copy text in my site. By adding a link in the header, I was able to import my favorite font from Google Fonts. I struggled slightly to understand how to import the font correctly with the link tag, but as previously stated, W3Schools helped me understand it.

- **Used a color pallette generated on Coolers** I generated a color pallette of five colors for my site. The most challenging aspect for this was thinking of how to incorporate all of the colors without them looking ugly, but I decided that leaving the main color of the site white worked well, and allowed me to use all the colors as either text colors or header background colors.
