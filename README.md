This project shows a sample of myself as a WPI student. It lists the courses I've taken and some experience I have. It also features a header with two buttons, a footer with my name and a copyright symbol, and follows a color pallete and is neatly organized. It was challenging because I found it difficult to work with separate workflows, as I am used to working with react.
