## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
    1. I styalised the site in general with a lavender backdground and text set to grape surrounded by a greyish-blue backdrop.
    2. I styalised header text with the Cinzel Decorative font.
    3. I styalised paragraph/bullet text with the Cormorant Unicase font.
    4. I styalised the table more minimally by keeping the default font and text-size, and without the border all other text has but I added a border around all of the items.
    5. I styalised the animation as a fuschia and light-pink square with a button with a shaded dark purple border.

- **JavaScript Animation**:
    I created a simple animation where a pink square covers a purple square then recedes back into itself.

- **Semantic HTML Tags**:
    1. Header for the title.
    2. Footer for an inspirational quote.
    3. A HREF for aformentioned inspirational quote.
    4. Table for some of my favourite media.
    5. Time for the current time.


## Design Achievements
- **Adobe Colour Palette**:
    I created a palette featuring five shades that centre around purple. A lavender shade for the backdrop of the site, a grape shade for text, a greyish-blue shade for text backgrounds, and a fuschia and light pink shades for the animation.

- **Google Font**:
    I important the fonts Cinzel Decorative for header text and Cormorant Unicase for normal text.
