This project shows a little piece of who I am as a person, as well as some of my academic achievements. On my site you will find
- some basic information about me
- my hobbies and interests outside of school
- my club affiliations
- the previous CS courses I have taken
- a small table of the sports and teams that I like to follow
- and a picture of the team I worked as a part of during my software engineering class.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I used CSS to style the entire page. This included using divs to seperate the rows of my site, with each div box having there own sub divs that changed various things. While doing this I styled: header, paragraphs, bulleted lists, tables, and images. Some more description about my styling:
    - Flexbox Layouts: I used the flex display option for my sectionContainer class to center and align all the rows of the site.
    - Box Styling: Each section has rounded corners, borders, dropshadows, and their own colors that utilize the palette.
    - Table Styling: I styled the ports table to have zebra-striped rows along with having hover effects that dim the table.
    - Gradient Background: I used the 3 most polarizing colors from the palette and made a gradient for the background of the website.
This was challenging because I had to carefully balance readability with aesthetics, making sure the colors werenâ€™t too bright or distracting.

- **Used a Simple Javascript Animation**: I used a very simple javascript animation on my site that loads each rows of the site 0.5s after each other, creating a smooth loading-in effect.
- **Other HTML Tags**: In my site I used the tags: link, table, img, p, b, h, ul + li, and script

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat as the font for all the text on my site.
- **Used a Color Palette from Adobe Color**: I used all the colors given to me by adobe after choosing my starting color (a picture of the palette can be found in the repo.
