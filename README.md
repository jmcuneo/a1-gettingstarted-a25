This project shows an introduction to myself with all of the necessary implementations, while also showing off some technical and design achievements. This project shows basic use of deployment, git, github and more. 
---------------------------
index.html - main html page
mystyles.css - custom css styles
app.js - javascript animations
server.js - node.js server

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: (1.)I created a div that is meant to organize the top section of my code including my intorduction, images and the spotify artist embeddings. I added 7 style rules for each separate div that I create to manage the width, margins, text alignment and image and spotify embedding sizing too. My main goal what to make it so that the content displayed side by side so that it wasn't in a full linear page and you had to scroll down a bunch. It also helped even out the space (2.) I also did this same pattern with the courses and experience content. I made an academic div and created style rules for the 3 divs that I had. This create consistent spacing and layout for the entire page. (3.) I created style rules for h1,h2 to ensure they had the same color and font styling, as well as a separate stlying rule for the body which was a colored gradient background (4.) I created style rules for p,li,a since they all involve basic text styling like color size and font. (5.) I created a style rule for the table and the table cells so that I could add border collapse so that the table itself looked more oganized (6.) I implemented a stlye rule separate for a list to ensure that the list was left aligned, since I didn't want all of the text to be left aligned, just specifically the list (7.) I created a style rule for the footer to create the block effect and to only show when you scroll to the bottom of the page. 

- **Semantic tags**: (1.) I created a footer block in html to add more of my color pallete and also added (2.) 3 links (using the a tag) to my linkedin, instagram and github to practive more linking. I also added a css style to the links to bold the link when you go to click on each link. (3.) I implemented 2 images to show the club I am involved in, along with one of my hobbies. (4.) I added in a table to show my knowledge within the listed technologies and to organize it easier. (5.) I added more lists to organize the courses that I have taken throughout my CS journey as well. (6.) I also implemented 4 embeddings of spotify artists so that they link to the spotify web player. I talked about my favorite artists in my introduction, so I wanted to implement the embedding code into my webpage too!
- **JavaScript Animation**: I implemented two javascript animations within app.js. The first animation is a general fade in whenever you reload or enter my webpage. It slowly shows all of my content. The other animation that I implemented was just fore more practive with javascript, which was a hover feature over my images. When you hover your cursor over the images, they pop out a bit and rotate to add a pop to them. I am used to using less lines of code in CSS to implement that animation, but again I wanted the practice of js. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site. Both as header text and regular text. I used variations of bolded font and italic 
- **Used all of the colors within my color palette**: #e6efe9, #c5f4e0, #a7c4a0, #8f8389, #c2eaba I used all of the colors within the color palette that I created through coolors because I really enjoy using coolors over the other options. One of the ways I implemented more of the color palette is I made my website body a linear gradient.
