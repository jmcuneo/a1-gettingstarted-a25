This project shows my ability to implement a basic design of a portfolio page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as deploying it using Github and Render.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
    - Added rules for h1 such as **color** (e.g. making "Information about John Diamond, class of 2026" light green)
    - Added rules for h2 such as **text-decoration** (e.g. making "Experience" underlined)
    - Added rules for h3 such as **border-radius** (e.g. making "Technologies" and "Working Experience" have rounded edges)
    - Added rules for img such as **width** and **height** (e.g. making the picture smaller on the screen)
    - Added rules for body such as **background-color** (e.g. making the color of the page dark green)

- **JavaScript animation**:
    - This animation was based off this [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp) example. Every 5 milliseconds it calls the inner function frame() to move the element 1 pixel to the right and bottom until it reaches (400px, 400px) which is the bottom of its container.
- **Semantic HTML tags**:
    - Added a **header** which contains a **nav** tag to quickly go to different parts of the page including "Home", "Experience", "Animaton"
    - Added a **figure** section with an **img** tag of me at my internship as well as a **figcaption** tag explain the picture
    - Added an **anchor** tag that contains a hyperlink to my LinkedIn
    - Added a **footer** tag to contain the author's name as well as a **time** tag to display when the blog was created

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from Adobe for this webpage**: 
    - [Closeup shot of a hard soap with bubbles and beautiful color textures](pallete.png)

- **Used the IBM Plex Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used IBM Plex Sans as the font for the primary copy text in my site.

## AI Usage

- Used Google AI to get examples of CSS rule styles, HTML Semantic tags, Javascript animations, etc and applied them to my specifc circumstances.
