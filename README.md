## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added rules for the p, h3, and body selectors. I then created some "text bubbles" which I  used to frame different sections of my page. I found this quite difficult initially as I  needed to properly frame the text inside. This required a little bit of trial and error. I then also a circlular frame for my image of the pawn using clip-path and altered the frame of my portrait. Finally I made a simple rotation animation for the pawn in javascript. With both of these images I also needed to use clip-path with trial and error to correctly frame them.
- **Semantic HTML**: I used a variety of semantic HTML tags such as lists for my technologies and experience, images for myself and a hobby, the header tag, links to my relevant "About me" and "Experience" headers, and the details tag for the user to decide whether to hide the summary or view my info in detail.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Karla Font from Google Fonts**: I used Karla as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used colour template from Adobe**: I also used a colour template similar to the colours in my portrait for my site.
                                       I decided to do this as I thought the colours would blend well overall!
