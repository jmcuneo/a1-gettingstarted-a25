This project serves as in introduction to me and my past CS experience. This project hopefully shows off some of my Web Design knowledge. This project has also taught me a lot about building and deploying a website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I created a styles.css file and added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, ul, li, table, th, td, summary, details, nav a, nav a:visited, and I made a stle for a custom box class. For my rules, I mainly changed colors, fonts, font size, width, padding/margins, and centering. If rules were similar, I tried to group them together (eg. nav a and nav a:visited).
- **Added Javascript Animation**: I created a simple javascript animation of some stars ping ponging from one side of the screen to the other. This script is seperated into the scripts.js file.
- **5 Unique HTML Tags**: I experimented with the footer, address, details + summary, table + th + tr + td, and nav tags. I used the table + th + tr + td tags to present my experience with Web Dev Tools. I used the footer and address tags to make a common website footer. I used the details + summary and nav tags to make a run easter egg.

## Design Achievements
- **Creeated and Used Color Palette**: I created a complementary color palette in adobe. This palette can be seen in ColorPalette.jpeg. I used this palette for my entire site. 
- **Used Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Fascinate Inline for headings in my code as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
