    <h1>Information about Utku Yakar</h1>
    <p>
      As a student of both computer science and data science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am passionate about developing impactful solutions with machine learning and software engineering. My exposure ranges from developing full-fledged web applications to developing robust machine learning models for real-world problems. From developing a system to predict house prices to researching the ethical implications of AI, my drive is always to learn and innovate. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my technical knowledge as a software developer or undergraduate researcher.
