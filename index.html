        <details open>
          <summary> I have lots of hobbies such as chess, soccer, and music! </summary> 
            <p>In my free time I play tons of chess on chess.com. I started playing around 5 years ago and I fell in love
            with learning. I have a bit of experience in over-the-board tournament games also!
            I've followed English soccer since I was a kid, and my favourite team is Liverpool. I play soccer recreationally
            all the time on campus and love watching games with my friends.
            I just recetly got into making music, specifically lofi music. I love to listening to lofi music in the background
            while I work and I'm looking to put out some of my music soon!</p>
