      I have what I like to call 'Golden Retriever energy' when it comes to coding, as I get genuinely excited about solving a tricky problem and even happier when the solution helps someone out. 
      As a Computer Science student at WPI, I channel that energy into building intuitive and useful software. Iâ€™m eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and see our work make a real difference.
